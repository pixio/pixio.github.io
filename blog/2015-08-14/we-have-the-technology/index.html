  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Last week I hinted at a Cocoapod featuring a camera and photo picker.  That particular codebase is cruftier than I had originally remembered.  In addition, it doesn&#39;t have a meaningful example project showcasing how easy it is to use.  While we prepare it for prime time, I&#39;d like to highlight some wonderful work by our own Kevin Wong and a pod I forgot to mention in last week&#39;s post.</p>

<h2 id="pxviewcontroller-kevin-wong-saves-the-day"><a href="https://github.com/pixio/PXViewController">PXViewController</a>: Kevin Wong saves the day!</h2>

<p>Last week I talked about the additions we had made to several iOS view controllers.  The way that pod came together was one view controller at a time and in the README.md for the pod I mentioned that I hadn&#39;t figured out a way to merge all the code nicely so that all subclasses of the various view controllers used a common version of each function. The benefits of not having four copies of each function are obvious as that kind of duplication is a classic example of a missed opportunity for code reuse.</p>

<p>At the time of writing that, Spencer Phippen and I were devising an <code>NSProxy</code>-based approach that would allow us to forward all the methods from the various view controllers to a common object that would handle the functionality. At the end of the week we had a semi-functional but inelegant test workspace that didn&#39;t quite handle <code>UI_APPERANCE_SELECTOR</code>s right.  Our plan was to fix those issues, clean up the code, and integrate the changes into the <code>PXViewController</code> pod. Our efforts would have been in vain.</p>

<p>Over the weekend Kevin took it upon himself to take the published pod and entirely refactor it based on a category and lots of swizzling. There was a small code review and a few fixes for fiddly functionality applied, but Kevin rebuilt my cluttered, slightly hacky subclasses into a state-of-the-art swizzling machine.  Maintenance, bug fixes, and new features will now be 300% easier to implement all thanks to the weekend whims of our resident super engineer.</p>

<p>Thanks Mr. Wong!</p>

<h2 id="uiimageview_afnetworking-blocks-slipping-through-the-cracks"><a href="https://github.com/pixio/UIImageView_AFNetworking-Blocks">UIImageView_AFNetworking-Blocks</a>: Slipping through the cracks</h2>

<p>When I set out to write this series, I looked at all of the private CocoaPods we had and sorted them based on dependency so I could publish things that built on top of the previous posts.  I then grouped them all into manageable chunks and saved my list, never looking back.  It turns out that I made (at least one) small mistake on the list.  Our &quot;category&quot; on <code>AFNetworking</code>&#39;s <code>UIImageView</code> category had not been included, even though <code>PXImageView</code> from last week depended on it. It’s on our GitHub now, but this will be the first writeup about it.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t noticed from the code released so far, I really like blocks. One wonderful thing about <code>AFNetworking</code> is the block-based interfaceit provides for dealing with networking request responses.  Unfortunately, one of the very useful categories that comes with it, <code>UIImageView+AFNetworking</code> doesn’t have the same format.  You could tell an image view to load its image from a URL, but you had no idea when it was done (Note: there is a method with completion blocks for setting an image with an NSURLRequest, but not a corresponding method that takes an NSURL).  I made a &quot;category&quot; that lets you  specify a completion to be called when the loading finishes (or fails).  The reason I say &quot;category&quot; is because it is really a category on <code>UIImageView</code> that contains the same interface as the <code>AFNetworking</code> category, but performs a load that allows a callback to be called when the image is finished.  This pod should be able to drop straight into your project and provide the additional methods with the completions.</p>

<h2 id="camera-and-beyond">Camera and Beyond</h2>

<p>Pending a cleanup of our camera pod, we&#39;ll publish it next week.  After that, there are almost twenty more pods we will be releasing; stay tuned for more posts and code. Hopefully these pods can prove to be useful to you in your work.</p>

<p><em>Credit for these and future code releases does not rest solely on my shoulders.  The brains of multiple Pixions were involved in the creation of these components. <a href="https://github.com/calvinkern">Calvin Kern</a> wrote almost every example project for all the CococaPods that have and will be released.  <a href="https://github.com/kwongius">Kevin Wong</a> fixed lots of bugs and edge cases beyond the pods he wrote himself.  Others, like <a href="https://github.com/sphippen">Spencer Phippen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cobbal">Andrew Cobb</a> provided code and ideas during the creation of these resources.</em></p>
