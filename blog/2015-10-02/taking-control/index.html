<p>Sounds simple.  And it is.  So I thought, &quot;let&#39;s take something simple, and make it simpler.&quot;  So I did. </p>

<p>But seriously, UI can be complicated and there are as many ideas about how users should indicate that do-the-thing should happen as there are things to do.  </p>

<p>What I have this week are a few controls that I use over and over again and that fill a little bit more of that functionality gap between what iOS gives you and what your designer wants of you.</p>

<h2 id="pxbutton"><a href="https://github.com/pixio/PXButton">PXButton</a></h2>

<p>What if I told you that you that you could center a side-by-side image and title in a button and it wouldn&#39;t make you grind your teeth in frustration when your text is so poorly aligned that you can&#39;t even remember what the last 6 characters were?  I know right?  Oh.  So that&#39;s just me?  Well, if you wanted that functionality anyway, here it is.</p>

<p>Meet <code>PXButton</code>.  A button class with a lot to offer.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Obviously, it allows you to display an image, a title, or both, with the image on one side or the other of the title.<br></li>
<li>Beyond that, the font is a <code>UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR</code> so you can be consistent without being repetitive.</li>
<li>You can choose to have a nice color gradient behind your button.  The class automatically creates a subtle gradient based on the background color you set.  It can look good or look like iOS 3, depending on your color choice and taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few other small things that are make the class a bit easier to use but aren&#39;t really worthy of a bullet point.  Look at the header.</p>

<h2 id="uiplaceholdertextview"><a href="https://github.com/pixio/UIPlaceholderTextView">UIPlaceholderTextView</a></h2>

<p>Let me start off by saying that this is not my code.  I&#39;m not here to take credit for the work of others online, just to throw more code at the very quickly growing mountain of libraries that is CocoaPods.</p>

<p>That being said, I use StackOverflow.com.  It&#39;s great, as you most likely already know.  Sometimes, though, it goes beyond mere greatness and someone will post a fantastic answer to a question.  An answer that doesn&#39;t just address the points in the question but becomes a beacon of hope and understanding for generations of engineers.  Here are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1328638/placeholder-in-uitextview">some</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19168423/what-are-the-new-documentation-commands-available-in-xcode-5">of</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11909629/waiting-until-two-async-blocks-are-executed-before-starting-another-block">my</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3477278/loop-in-c-help">favorites</a>. And once upon a time, I turned one of these into a CocoaPod.</p>

<p>Say hello to <code>UIPlaceholderTextView</code>.  It&#39;s like a <code>UITextView</code>, but it has a placeholder text property.  You know, just like the built-in <code>UITextField</code> class.  Hey Apple, this is a useful feature and the entire community would love it if you added it.</p>

<h2 id="pxinsettextfield"><a href="https://github.com/pixio/PXInsetTextField">PXInsetTextField</a></h2>

<p>In much the same spirit of the previous one, I added functionality that should exist but doesn&#39;t.  <code>UITextView</code> has a property which allows you to inset the content from the edge.  This one is also based on a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2694411/text-inset-for-uitextfield">StackOverflow question</a>.</p>

<p>PXInsetTextField should give you the power to do something you always wanted to do with <code>UITextField</code> but couldn&#39;t.  It did for me, at least.</p>

<h2 id="pxicontextview"><a href="https://github.com/pixio/PXIconTextView">PXIconTextView</a></h2>

<p>This control might be a bit more niche than the last three.  It was developed for a specific use case (the text entry view for a chat screen).  The purpose of this control is to display a text field with a small icon in the top left corner.  As text is entered into the field, it grows in height to accommodate the new lines until it reaches a maximum height you specify.  It&#39;s pretty simple but also pretty specific.  If this sounds like your cup of chips, it&#39;s there for you.  Woooo.  On to the next.</p>

<h2 id="pxmaskbutton"><a href="https://github.com/pixio/PXMaskButton">PXMaskButton</a></h2>

<p>What if you wanted a button.  But not just any button, a button that has an icon and some text and then cuts the icon and text out of the button and makes it transparent.  What if you didn&#39;t have to implement <code>drawRect:</code> to do it?  It&#39;d be great right?  I wouldn&#39;t know.  But you can, if you want.  All you have to do is use <code>PXMaskButton</code>.  </p>

<p>Some other things you can do with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a border.  This is great because this class can be used as a checkbox thing too. So clear with a colored icon and text and a border when unselected, and gradient with cut out text and image when it&#39;s not.</li>
<li>A font and font size that can be customized at a class level thanks to <code>UIAppearance</code>.</li>
<li>An optional gradient.  Gradients can look good, Ive, live with it.</li>
<li>Use it as a checkbox.  I alluded to this above and it&#39;s a good feature.  Think of this: you can make a grid of these babies and it would be the best collection view ever.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="miscellaneous-methods">Miscellaneous Methods</h2>

<p>So there are a few things I have left in my backlog of unpublished code.  Next week, you get the pleasure of reading me describe them in not quite enough detail.  There are a few things in there that I really liked because they are simple and useful but <em>really</em> niche.  Maybe one other person on Earth will also find them useful.  Look forward to it. </p>

<p><em>Credit for these and future code releases does not rest solely on my shoulders.  The brains of multiple Pixions were involved in the creation of these components. <a href="https://github.com/calvinkern">Calvin Kern</a> wrote almost every example project for all the CococaPods that have and will be released.  <a href="https://github.com/kwongius">Kevin Wong</a> fixed lots of bugs and edge cases beyond the pods he wrote himself.  Others, like <a href="https://github.com/sphippen">Spencer Phippen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cobbal">Andrew Cobb</a> provided code and ideas during the creation of these resources.</em></p>
