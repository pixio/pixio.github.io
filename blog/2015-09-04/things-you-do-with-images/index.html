    <h2 id="pictures-are-worth-1000-words">Pictures are worth 1000 words</h2>

<p>And usually, many thousands more bytes.  Within those bytes is something people find so compelling they will spend double-digit percentages of their days staring at a screen (just barely) smaller than their hand.  Or pictures of cats.  In either case, someone has to be the one who puts those images there.  That someone is a developer.</p>

<p>When developers put images in front of users, sometimes things go wrong and they&#39;re upside-down or too big (and consequently slow).  Sometimes we just have to change them slightly:  everything from rounding the corners, to blurring, to tinting them (think sepia) for stylistic reasons.  So, I&#39;ve assembled a collection of some of the most useful additions to the <code>UIImage</code> class categories that I use again and again into a pod called <code>UIImageUtilities</code>.</p>

<h2 id="uiimageutilities"><a href="https://github.com/pixio/UIImageUtilities">UIImageUtilities</a></h2>

<p>The categories included in this pod are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>UIImage+Blur</code>: taken from <a href="http://whoisryannystrom.com/">Ryan Nystrom</a>&#39;s <code>RNBlurModalView</code>, I found this category to be really useful on its own.  When iOS 7 started showcasing blur and transparency everywhere, the customer demand and designer insistence for similar visuals boomed.  Having a concise, effective way to blur makes these designs that much easier to implement.</li>
<li><code>UIImage+Resize</code>: resize your images to fit within a specified width, height, or both.  Sometimes your images are huge and you want thumbnails, sometimes you need to upload to a restrictive server, sometimes you just want less of a memory footprint.  Resize has you covered.</li>
<li><code>UIImage+RoundCorners</code>: When rounding the corners of your view&#39;s layer just won&#39;t cut it (hahahahaha....ha) you can round your images&#39; corners with this.</li>
<li><code>UIImage+Tinted</code>: Tint your images a particular color.  This category allows you to specify whether you respect luminosity or not (whether you treat every pixel like color or transparent vs scaling the color applied to each pixel by the luminosity of that pixel before tinting).  It&#39;s basically sepia for free and <code>UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysTemplate</code> permanently.</li>
<li><code>UIImage+fixOrientation</code>: there once was an app that got images from the camera (just one?).  It had problems with the image orientation not matching the presentation orientation in weird ways.  The developer for this project threw up his hands and then brought them down hard on all future images: they would be re-rendered with their orientation “baked-in” to avoid presentation problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>These pods encompass a diverse set of functionality, but they all have a use somewhere in your apps if you try hard enough and believe in yourself.  Seriously, though, they might end up saving you some time and keep you from rewriting code again and again in project after project.</p>

<h2 id="pxfrostedimageview"><a href="https://github.com/pixio/PXFrostedImageView">PXFrostedImageView</a></h2>

<p>Between the releases of iOS 7 and iOS 8, there was a period of suffering for developers of apps that needed to look their best on the new OS.  Apple had shown off some really good looking UI updates and wow&#39;ed their users.  In so doing, they made all their current apps obsolete-looking.  Developers had to struggle to update to the new design paradigm and all those blurs which Apple seemed content to keep to themselves.  Undeterred, we created a view that displays an image as if it were rendered with the fancy frosted blur effect that Apple had smattered everywhere in their new OS.  It was simple, easy to use, and a heck of a lot better than sticking your content under a bloated, abused <code>UITabBar</code>.</p>

<p>Then iOS 8 came along and Apple bestowed upon its people the gift of <code>UIBlurEffect</code> such that they could emulate their masters&#39; design greatness.  And so <code>PXFrostedImageView</code> stands as a monument to the adaptability and cunning of developers that fought bravely to forge new apps in the wake of Jony Ive&#39;s UI revelations.  </p>

<p>See if it&#39;s useful to you, or simpler than using a UIBlurEffect. Sometimes the old ways are the best, sometimes not. Either way, it was a cinch to implement with the categories in <code>UIImageUtilities</code> and the previously released <code>PXImageView</code>.</p>

<h2 id="things-to-come">Things to come</h2>

<p>I will be traveling during the next two Fridays and will be temporarily passing the torch to Spencer Phippen.  He&#39;s got some neat wizardry to reveal to you that may help you accomplish tasks you were frustrated with before, but will definitely open your eyes to new ways to approach problems.  Look forward to it; I certainly am.</p>

<p><em>Credit for these and future code releases does not rest solely on my shoulders.  The brains of multiple Pixions were involved in the creation of these components. <a href="https://github.com/calvinkern">Calvin Kern</a> wrote almost every example project for all the CococaPods that have and will be released.  <a href="https://github.com/kwongius">Kevin Wong</a> fixed lots of bugs and edge cases beyond the pods he wrote himself.  Others, like <a href="https://github.com/sphippen">Spencer Phippen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cobbal">Andrew Cobb</a> provided code and ideas during the creation of these resources.</em></p>
