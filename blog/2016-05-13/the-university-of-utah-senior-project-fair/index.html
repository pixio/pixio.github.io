  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Recently, the University of Utah held its annual fair to show off the year-long projects created by the Computer Science department&#39;s graduating seniors.</p>

<h1 id="we-were-invited">We were invited</h1>

<p>I swear! Don&#39;t get me wrong, we discussed possibly renting uniforms that bore a striking resemblance to some of the University of Utah employees you&#39;ll see around campus. Heck, there were even talks about who would fit under a food cart with a white blanket draped over it. In the end, the Computer Science Department at Utah asked one of our Founders, Matt Stoker (who also teaches the mobile development class), to judge so we all tagged along.</p>

<h1 id="we-were-impressed">We were impressed</h1>

<p>Judging gave us a unique opportunity to interact with the students that worked on these projects. We were given a run down on their software&#39;s functionality and the technology/effort that went into making them. Here are some of our favorites:</p>

<h2 id="principia"><a href="http://principia.cc/">Principia</a></h2>

<p>Principia is a physics playground. It is intended to help students learn physics and finish their homework. You can enter in the constraints of a homework problem, simulate it, and check to make sure your calculations weren&#39;t off.</p>

<p>We were impressed with the detail of the physics simulations. Also, we thought that their app was very thought out, and polished enough to be used in production.</p>

<p>My favorite part, however, was this simulation:</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/posts/internal/the_joker_got_away.png" alt="alt text" title="Batmobile lost its wheel"></p>

<p>If the batmobile did in fact lose a wheel, would the joker be able to get away?</p>

<p>You can see this project <a href="http://principia.cc/">here</a></p>

<h2 id="schoolbloc"><a href="http://schoolbloc.co/">SchoolBloc</a></h2>

<p>Working with a local charter school, SchoolBloc set out to create a system that would help schools figure out an optimal schedule for each one of their enrolled students.</p>

<p>We were impressed because we thought this team took the correct approach in using a constraint solver. We also appreciated the fact that this team was working with a local school to solve an immediate issue.</p>

<p>You can see this project <a href="http://schoolbloc.co/">here</a></p>

<h2 id="played"><a href="http://www.playedsmart.com/">PlayED</a></h2>

<p>We at Pixio appreciate gamification, and PlayED is aiming to do just that. PlayED is a platform for teachers to give elementary-aged students &quot;assignments&quot; (and by assignments I mean math and english focused games to play) and track their progress and scores through an analytics dashboard.</p>

<p>We were mainly impressed with the amount that the PlayED team was able to get done. They were able to create 3 example games in WebGL, as well as an intuitive dashboard application for the teachers to access their students&#39; data.</p>

<p>You can see this project <a href="http://www.playedsmart.com/">here</a></p>

<h1 id="the-competition">The competition</h1>

<p>In the end, SchoolBloc came in third, Principia came in second, and AirU (an app that gathers and displays air quality across the United States) won the competition.</p>

<h1 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h1>

<p>We all had a lot of fun meeting a bunch of really smart people and talking to them about what cool things they were able to accomplish over the past few months. We love being able to be involved in the community, and look forward to events like this.</p>

<p>One sentence summary: We came, we judged, we got free pizza.</p>
