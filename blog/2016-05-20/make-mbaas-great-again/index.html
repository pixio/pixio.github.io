  <article class="post-content">
    <p>It&#39;s Google IO time again and one of the biggest announcements from the keynote was the announcement of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> expanding to a full mobile platform. Firebase was known mostly as a competitor to Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a> service and for their realtime databases. With Facebook sunsetting Parse, Firebase is quickly becoming the go-to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_backend_as_a_service">MBaaS (Mobile Backend as a Service)</a> provider for many mobile developers.</p>

<h2 id="more-powerful-more-complete">More Powerful, More Complete</h2>

<p>The new Firebase Storage provides reliable storage backed by the existing Google Cloud Storage. Additionally, the integrations with the Firebase Authentication tools allow tweaking the permissions of files. Firebase users have been forced to implement their own storage solutions using Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or (worst of all) storing a Base64 string in their realtime database. No more of that nonsense!</p>

<p>Google Cloud Messaging is being rebranded as Firebase Cloud Messaging and it includes all the cloud messaging functionality of which you are used to along with Firebase&#39;s SDKs sprinkled on top. The SDK is quite powerful and helps reduce the amount of boilerplate code, especially in iOS. In iOS, the Firebase SDK employs <a href="http://nshipster.com/method-swizzling/">method swizzling</a> to automatically write a default implementation for methods that you are required to implement.</p>

<h2 id="show-me-the-new-stuff">Show Me The New Stuff</h2>

<p>There is a lot of great new functionality in Firebase and much of it consists of existing Google services that have been tweaked to better focus on mobile development. Analytics, GCM, Cloud Test Lab, AdWords, and AdMob are now part of the unified Firebase platform and the integration into Firebase allows them to work together easily.</p>

<p>Remote Config makes it incredibly easy to update configuration variables on the fly. It takes care of caching the results retrieved from the server and setting default values. Being part of Firebase allows targetted updates of configurations. For example, you could do a slow rollout of a new feature to users and disable that functionality if there&#39;s an issue. This could easily be employed to perform A/B tests.</p>

<p>Dynamic Links are new to Firebase and add incredible functionality. Dynamic Links open to different content based on which device you are on. If the user does not have the native app installed, they will be sent to their respective app store from which the app can be downloaded. A really powerful feature of Dynamic Links is that they are able to persist through the app store. This allows you to track the efficacy of new user acquisition as well as provide the best possible onboarding experience for your users.</p>

<h2 id="that-39-s-cool-but-why-do-i-care">That&#39;s cool, but why do I care?</h2>

<p>Firebase remains a powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_backend_as_a_service">MBaaS</a> and much of the added functionality helps to make it even better. However, a huge focus of the new and improved platform is analytics. Most of the tools provided by the new Firebase are tightly integrated with the analytics suite. This integration allow you to understand your target users as well as their interactions with your application in it&#39;s entirety. As developers, it&#39;s easy for us to think that we are always right (and our users are wrong) and that&#39;s a dangerous thought. It&#39;s important to understand our users and then react and respond to them. Ultimately, this leads to a better quality application.</p>

<h2 id="i-see-dead-people">I See Dead People</h2>

<p>I&#39;m scared. I&#39;m really scared. What happens if Firebase goes away in a year? Google doesn&#39;t have a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products#Discontinued_products_and_services">track record</a>. Parse had over 500,000 users and Facebook still killed the service. Why won&#39;t Firebase disappear just like Parse?</p>

<p>None of us can predict the future of how Firebase will fare and by using the services, you are placing your trust in a 3rd party that you have no control over. With Firebase approaching the numbers that Parse was seeing, it&#39;s hard not to draw comparisons. It&#39;s up to you do to the cost-benefit analysis of the possibility that Firebase gets shut down.</p>

<p>In order to mitigate the possiblity that Firebase disappears, it&#39;s important to understand the system at a high level. If you have no idea how a particular system that you are using works and you&#39;re locked in, the pain of migrating away all the more frustrating. Architecting your client-side application in such a way that the backend infrastructure implementation details will help you mitigate any issues that may arise in the future.</p>

<h2 id="easily-breeze-ily-firebase-ily">Easily, Breeze-ily, Firebase-ily</h2>

<p>The great thing about the new Firebase Platform is the modularity. It&#39;s not an all or nothing system. You can pick and choose components and still use external services such as Twitter&#39;s <a href="https://fabric.io/">Fabric mobile platform</a> or <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/analytics/">Flurry Analytics</a>. Employing tools provided by Firebase allows you to really quickly build a full application without a backend and understand your users.</p>

<p>Firebase (and other tools and platforms in the ecosystem) are important tools for your application. They provide vast functionality to help your application succeed in a large market. They allow you to focus on creating the application, and not the support structure around that application. Whether or not you use any of Firebase&#39;s tools, it&#39;s valuable to understand the problems they solve and keep those in mind when building your own applications.</p>
