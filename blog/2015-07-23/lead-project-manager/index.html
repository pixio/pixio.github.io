    <p>I’m looking for a solid Project Manager. Maybe you know of someone who is looking for a change of pace? Feel free to forward this to anyone who may be interested.</p>

<p>This person will be my right hand for all things related to projects. Most of these would be Pixio software projects. Some of them would be external projects with the opportunity for equity share. Some of the things this person would be helping me with are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Helping out one of the US Olympic Teams prepare for the next olympics.</p></li>
<li><p>Working with start-ups from Utah, California, and Korea to refine their plans, develop pitches, find funding, and build their products.</p></li>
<li><p>Working with existing big businesses to develop new revenue streams, mostly based around smartphone applications, and “Internet of Things” hardware.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining a website to tell the world about all of these things as the NDAs are lifted one-by-one.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Things would start with a paid one-month trial, probably around 20 hours per week. If things go well, there would be potential to expand significantly from there. Good pay and tons of interesting options.</p>

<p>More on me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzoswank">LinkedIn</a> if needed.</p>

<h3 id="job-description">JOB DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>To help me focus exclusively on helping out new startups, I need someone who’s expert at handling quite a bit.</p>

<p>The Lead Project Manager’s responsibilities would include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Taking charge of Pixio’s project calendar and corralling some other project managers. It’s quite a bit of delegation, which means getting to know the other project managers strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right project manager for the right task.</p></li>
<li><p>Spearheading the editorial calendar for Pixio’s blog, and an entrepreneurial podcast for the next 6-12 months. There are too many other high level projects that I’m trying to balance right now, and it’s too much for me to handle at even 12 hours per day. I need someone to manage most or all of it, including…</p></li>
<li><p>Helping me reach out to would-be podcast guests and book them, prep them, confirm them, etc., whether celebrities, world-class investors, or scientists.</p></li>
<li><p>Helping me draft blog posts that I don’t otherwise have the bandwidth to adapt.</p></li>
<li><p>Sourcing great guest posts and guest authors. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="perks">PERKS</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>You’d be working behind the curtains on a lot of entrepreneurial projects, and there are easy opportunities to nurture startups and then jump head first into one (or more!) of them if anything catches your interest.</p></li>
<li><p>I will ask your advice and look to you for original ideas, new experiments, and more.</p></li>
<li><p>You will also need to spend time with some of the most impressive people in my network. </p></li>
<li><p>You’ll probably have the opportunity to eat a lot of Korean food, there will be strange assignments, and you get to work with the most hyperactive person you have ever met. That’s me. There won’t be a lot of boredom.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="job-requirements">JOB REQUIREMENTS</h3>

<p>Please note that most of the below are “must have,” not “nice to have.”</p>

<p>First and foremost, you need to understand and love the goal of the content we develop and the activities we plan — helping people build their startup and plan an exit, and providing resources for them to be able to do this.</p>

<p>The idea of helping people build their dream startup must make you excited to conquer the world, do huge things, and tackle big problems. Alignment with the above mission is the most important, but you should also be able to demonstrate the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have some sort of leadership experience where you are telling people unapologetically what they need to do and having them actually get it done.</li>
<li>Be a great writer and equally good at editing/improving other people’s writing.</li>
<li>Have managed tight deadlines.</li>
<li>Ideal: Have managed other people, particularly writers and/or technical people (programmers).</li>
<li>Ideal but not required: Live in or near Salt Lake City.  Remote is also possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>I need someone with some amount of experience. I cannot take people who don’t check most of the above boxes. While there will be some degree of mentoring, I am not looking to mentor someone from a starting point of zero-action/zero-results. This person will need to already be in motion. If they aren’t already doing something amazing but secretly harbor a desire to come work in a place where they are going to be evaluating new project ideas and new startup ideas day in and day out, it’s probably going to be very difficult for them.</p>

<h3 id="downsides">DOWNSIDES</h3>

<p>I should probably not begin emails with the subject line: &quot;Do you know someone who wants the hardest job ever?&quot; Still, the unvarnished truth is probably the best. </p>

<p>Being my Lead Project Manager will not be easy. Rewarding? Definitely. Exciting at many times? Absolutely. Easy? Not likely. Think of it like a professional sports team.  We’re not going to haze you or anything stupid, but we take things very, very seriously. People are going to come to us for advice and we need to give them something that is valuable today, tomorrow, and two year from now. If you have the right personality for it, you’ll love this. But…</p>

<p>Here are some fair expectations:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am all over the place. There may be twenty projects flying through the air at any given time that we are starting on or evaluating. We will kill off a lot of them in the early stages, but if you can’t handle rapid fire complexity, you will probably go insane.</li>
<li>I live and die by deadlines. They are absolutely sacred, and I am merciless about this.</li>
<li>You will need to be self-directed and very self-organized. Besides inflexible deadlines, I won’t provide a lot of structure. I assume you’re bringing a lot of your own process and best practices.</li>
<li>You need good mental and physical stamina, and you MUST have the discipline to “turn off” and recharge during off hours. You should have a regular exercise regimen or activities for decompressing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="still-interested-next-steps">STILL INTERESTED? NEXT STEPS…</h3>

<p>Great!</p>

<p>Please email me at <a href="mailto:LSwank@pixio.com">LSwank@pixio.com</a> to tell me about yourself.  Any questions?  E-mail me. </p>

<p>Stay awesome,</p>

<p>Lorenzo</p>
